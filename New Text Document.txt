In a React project, create two child components named Child1 and Child2. Load the tips.csv dataset within the App component and pass the data to the child components via props.
Child1 Component: Create a scatter plot of total bill vs tips that includes axis labels and a title.
Child2 Component: Create a bar chart to display the average tips for each day, also including axis labels and a title.
The expected output of the application will be as follows:

Deployment: Deploy your application to GitHub Pages. Ensure that the webpage is accessible online through a GitHub Pages URL. (How to Deploy React App to GitHub Pages | Step by step.)

Grading Rubric:
Child1 Component: Scatter Plot of Total Bill vs. Tips (50 Points)

Slight deviations in positioning are acceptable as long as they still look visually pleasing. However, significant misalignment will result in a loss of points. The color of the circles and bars should be #69b3a2, though you are free to use any color you prefer.
